As an independent media artist, working in both fine arts photography and film. Story has always been image for me. My work as cinematographer taught me the interpretation of script into light, tone, colour, and movement. My fine arts photography taught me to find narrative and juxtaposition in a singular moment never to be repeated.
          In 2012, I went to India with a Canon 5D, and set off with my then twenty-year old son. Using my stills camera as video camera, I set up shots in the streets using the real world as our setting. I now think of it as a found film. An experimental hybrid fiction of a real journey.
          I wanted to shoot India’s beauty and surge of life, but didn’t want to be a voyeur.I was looking for the sensory experience of an outsider travelling through another land and responding visually to the intense experience and movement of that country.
        I have four children and on their eighteenth birthdays I have taken them somewhere in the world to encounter themselves. These are challenging and off-the-beaten path journeys. Coming of age trips. My intention being to help them see beyond the comfort and privilege of their North American world. For each of them, these trips have been life changing experiences.</p>
